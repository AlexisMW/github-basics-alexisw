For csp assignment

Read me, this assignment is cool. I have wanted to learn GitHub for a while. I have just started off and I am pretty confused. I'm telling you this to test the README file. 

### Formally and officially,
This repository is an environment where I can learn the basics of utilizing GitHub. The repository includes this README file and a Hello World Python program.


## GitHub Basics Assessment Questions Answers:
1. GitHub is the central repository platform, storing the code and files, while Git transfers the files from GitHub to Visual Studio Code.
   
2. A GitHub repository is an accessible environment that stores code and files. The three essential compounds of a repository are the README file, the program file, and the commits history.
   
3. Cloning a repository creates a clone of the repository where the changes made in the clone can be pushed to and synced with the original repository. Forking a repository creates a separate independent clone of the repository where the changes cannot be added to or affect the original repo.
   
4. By using GitHub flow, you first create branches and make independent commits/updates to them that are separate from the main branch currently functioning. Then, once you want that code to be implemented in a main branch, you can make a pull request so other collaborators can review your code/branch. Once the pull request is approved, you can merge it so that the changes appear on the default branch.
   
5. The purpose of a pull request is to have your code reviewed and checked for bugs or errors before it is implemented and affects the main branch code. The pull quest process starts with you making a pull request that can be drafted for early feedback, then the pull request can be reviewed by collaborators and you can mention specific collaborators. The request should have comments and details describing the code. Then your request can get approved and then merged to the main branch.
   
6. Issues contribute to project management in GitHub by giving a space for collaborators or people to bring up issues about the programs that can be discussed or fixed. Issues can be used effectively by bringing up an issue, inquiring about a bug or problem they have, or discussing how to fix an issue.
    
7. Commit messages are important so you in the future and other collaborators can know what each iteration or update to the code was and does. A good commit message should explain the changes accurately and concisely. For example, renamed the variable for the salad maker (to salad_maker).
    
8. Branches help in the development process by creating a separate branch to develop and work on code without making changes to the main functioning one. That way you can make changes, review them for errors and bugs and get them functioning, then add them to the main thing. Using branches instead of working directly on the main branch allows you to test things without fear of messing up the main ongoing branch of the program.
